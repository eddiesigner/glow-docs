# Update Theme

Before installing a new version of this theme please do not forget to **create a backup** of the version you are currently using.

**If you have not modified any files** in the theme folder previously, you can simply upload the new file `glow.zip` in the Ghost Admin and that's it.

However, **if you have made changes to some files previously**, you must apply those changes to the files in the folder corresponding to the latest version, otherwise **your changes will be overwritten**.

::: tip
If you want to make small changes to the theme (e.g. style changes), it is best to do it directly in the Ghost Admin so they can be persisted.
