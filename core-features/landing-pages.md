# Landing Pages

Glow has full support for better landing pages, a feature recently introduced by Ghost. With this, it's possible to hide, among other elements, the top part of a page. This allows the creation of stunning landing pages by utilizing various dynamic cards in the editor, such as headers, signup cards, images, etc.

Below, you can see an example of what can be achieved with this feature:

You can also see a [live demo](https://glow.eduardogomez.io/landing-page/), isn't it great?

To hide the title and feature image from a page, all you need to do is click the toggle `Show the title and feature image` in the page settings:

This option is only available in the new editor and can only be used for pages, not for posts.
