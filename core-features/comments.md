# Comments

Glow supports both native comments and third-party solutions. This guide describes how to enable both options.

## Native Comments

Native comments are disabled by default. If you want to use them in your publication, you must first enable them in `Settings` --> `Membership` --> `Access`, as shown in the following screenshot:

If the user has access according to the option you have selected, they will see an icon with the number of comments at the top of the post. They can click on it to go to the comments section and participate in the conversation.

You can learn more about Comments in the [official documentation](https://ghost.org/help/commenting/).

## Third-party Comments

Glow is also compatible with third-party solutions, you can use any of the available [Ghost integrations](https://ghost.org/integrations/?tag=community), the installation is usually quite simple, below you can see an example of how to add **Disqus** and **Cove** comments to your publication. The setup process for other solutions is pretty much the same.

### Disqus

Glow integrates perfectly with [Disqus](https://disqus.com/), all you have to do is the following:

1. After creating an account in Disqus, you have to create a new site in the [admin](https://disqus.com/admin) of that platform

2. You must copy the **shortname** of your brand new site, this can be found in the preferences of your site

3. Create a backup of the theme file (`glow.zip`)

4. Unzip the theme file

5. Open the file `partials/comments.hbs` with a code editor and comment out the following lines of code:

```hbs
{{!-- // [!code ++]
  {{#if comments}}
    <section id="comments" class="gl-comments">
      <div class="gl-comments__wrapper js-comments">
        {{comments}}
      </div>
    </section>
  {{/if}}
--}} // [!code ++]
```

6. Remove the comments surrounding the following code block located at the end of the file:

```hbs
{{!--  // [!code --]
<section id="comments" class="gl-comments">
  <div class="gl-comments__wrapper js-comments">
    <!-- Paste here the provided code snippet -->
  </div>
</section>
--}}  // [!code --]
```

7. Paste the code provided by Disqus below `<!-- Paste here the provided code snippet -->` so that it looks somewhat like the following:

```hbs
<section id="comments" class="gl-comments">
  <div class="gl-comments__wrapper js-comments">
    <!-- Paste here the provided code snippet -->
    <div id="disqus_thread"></div>
    <script>
      var disqus_config = function () {
        this.page.url = "{{url absolute="true"}}";
        this.page.identifier = "ghost-{{comment_id}}"
      };
      (function () {
        var d = document, s = d.createElement('script');
        s.src = 'https://SHORT_NAME.disqus.com/embed.js'; // [!code highlight]
        s.setAttribute('data-timestamp', +new Date());
        (d.head || d.body).appendChild(s);
      })();
    </script>
  </div>
</section>
```

8. Replace `SHORT_NAME` with the **shortname** you got in step 2

8. Finally save the file, zip the theme folder and upload it again

### Cove

[Cove](https://cove.chat/) is an alternative comment platform that allows you to embed fully functional comment threads from your subscribed members, allowing you to build a community for your membership audience on Ghost. In other words, Cove lets subscribers of your content log in and comment on your content.

There is an [official guide](https://ghost.org/integrations/cove-comments/) on how to integrate Cove with Ghost, the only difference is step 4 (Add the code to your theme), the difference is that you have to replace all the content of `partials/comments.hbs` with the following block of code:

```hbs
{{#if @site.members_enabled}}
  <section id="comments" class="gl-comments">
    <div class="gl-comments__wrapper js-comments">
      <!-- Paste here the provided code snippet -->
      <h2><span id="cove-count"></span> Comments</h2>
      <div id="cove"></div>

      {{#if @member}}
          <p>Signed in as {{@member.email}} Â· <a href="javascript:" data-members-signout>Sign out</a></p>
      {{else}}
          <p>Become a {{@site.title}} member below to join the conversation. As a member, you will also receive new posts by email (you can unsubscribe at any time).</p>
          <form data-members-form="signin" id="cove-login">
          <input class="cove-input" data-members-email type="email" required="true" placeholder="your@email.com" />
          <button type="submit" class="cove-button">Sign in to comment</button>
          <span class="signin-success" style="display:none">Great! Please check your inbox for a log in link.</span>
          <span class="signin-error" style="display:none">Something didn't work. Please try again.</span>
          </form>
      {{/if}}

      <script>
      const Cove = {
          publication: "YOUR_SITE_ID",
          contentId: "{{id}}",
          memberId: "{{@member.uuid}}",
          memberEmail: "{{@member.email}}"
      }
      </script>
    </div>
  </section>
{{/if}}
```

Finally save the file, zip the theme folder and upload it again.
