### Using a different URL

If you want to use a different URL, `/subscribe` for example, you can follow these steps:

1. Create a backup of the theme file (`glow.zip`)

2. Unzip the theme file

3. Open the file `routes.yaml` with a code editor

4. Replace `newsletter` with `subscribe` as is shown in the highlighted lines in the following example:

```yaml
  /newsletter/:  // [!code --]
  /subscribe/: // [!code ++]
    template: newsletter
    data: page.newsletter  // [!code --]
    data: page.subscribe // [!code ++]
```

::: warning
Please note that the `template` should keep the same value `newsletter`, otherwise it won't work.

5. Save your changes

6. Head to the Ghost Admin and upload the file `routes.yaml` in `Settings` --> `Labs` --> `Beta features` --> `Routes`
